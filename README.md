Z⁰ Boson Analysis
This project provides a Python script for analyzing Z⁰ boson data using chi-square minimization techniques. The script features basic user interaction to process and visualize data effectively. The repository includes two CSV files containing sample datasets used for analysis.

Features
Data Filtering and Merging: The script processes and merges the provided datasets (z_boson_data_1.csv and z_boson_data_2.csv), allowing the user to save the filtered and combined data as a new file.
3D Chi-Square Contour Visualization: Users can generate a 3D contour plot of the chi-square distribution, providing a visual representation of parameter space.
Interactive Menu: The script offers an interactive menu where users can choose to:
Save the filtered and merged data.
Visualize the 3D chi-square contours.
Exit the program.

Files in the Repository
w23058yf_zboson.py: The main Python script for data processing and visualization.
z_boson_data_1.csv: First dataset containing Z⁰ boson-related measurements.
z_boson_data_2.csv: Second dataset containing additional measurements.

Project Overview
This project was designed to demonstrate data analysis and visualization techniques in high-energy physics. It leverages Python programming for numerical optimization and interactive visualization. The included features allow users to process datasets, visualize chi-square distributions, and save processed data efficiently.
